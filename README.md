## Architecture & Design Decisions

### WebSocket Management
- Implemented a custom WebSocket hook for managing Binance connections
- Handles automatic reconnection and connection state management
- Separates real-time data concerns from UI components

### Component Structure
- Modular components for better maintainability
- Shared state management through props
- Clear separation of concerns between data fetching and presentation

### Styling Approach
- Used Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design
- Custom dark theme optimized for trading interfaces
- Component-specific styles for better organization

### Approach & Trade-offs

My approach to building this real-time trading dashboard focused on creating a robust, reliable, and visually appealing trading interface:

1. **WebSocket Service Architecture**
   - Created a dedicated `binanceWebSocket` service to handle all API and WebSocket communications
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for connection drops and data validation
   - Built connection management system that properly disconnects existing connections when switching pairs/timeframes
   - Added automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - Structured the service to handle multiple data streams (klines, orderbook) efficiently

2. **TradingView Chart Integration**
   - Customized lightweight-charts for a professional trading experience
   - Implemented dynamic volume bars with color adaptation
   - Added custom date/time formatting for different timeframes
   - Built price formatting logic that adapts to asset value ranges
   - Ensured chart stability during WebSocket disconnections or data gaps
   - Optimized performance for high-frequency updates

3. **Custom OrderBook Implementation**
   - Developed a custom order book visualization using shadcn/ui components
   - Implemented efficient update mechanism to handle high-frequency price changes
   - Created smooth animations for price updates while maintaining performance
   - Added depth visualization with dynamic scaling
   - Integrated error boundaries to prevent UI breaks during data issues

4. **UI/UX Design Decisions**
   - Selected a dark green theme optimized for extended trading sessions
   - Chose Inter font for optimal readability of numbers and text
   - Added visual feedback for connection status and data updates
   - Created consistent spacing and alignment across all components

5. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for failed WebSocket connections
   - Added fallback states for missing or invalid candlestick data
   - Created loading states that prevent UI jumps during data updates
   - Built validation for incoming data to prevent chart artifacts
   - Added retry mechanisms for failed connections with user feedback

The main trade-offs were:
- Chose custom WebSocket implementation over libraries for better control
- Used local state management instead of global state for simplicity
- Implemented custom order book visualization for specific styling needs
- Customizing TradingView's lightweight-charts for low value coins and web design
- Built modular components despite initial setup overhead

These decisions were made to prioritize reliability and user experience while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
